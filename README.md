# TYPO3 extension in2frontendauthentication

## Introduction

TYPO3 extension to simulate fe-login for a group if IP-address (IPv4 and IPv6) fits.
You can define multiple IPs and ranges per group in backend.

## Introduction

![Set an IP address in a fe_groups record](Documentation/Images/backend_fegroup.png)

![Define that a content should only be shown if a group has authenticated](Documentation/Images/backend_pagecontent.png)

![Show content if authenticated in frontend](Documentation/Images/frontend_pagecontent.png)

**Note:** This allows you to show/hide contentelements, pages and other records to a specific usergroup.
But "showAtAnyLogin" or "hideAtAnyLogin" is not supported.

## Requirements and installation

```
composer require in2code/in2frontendauthentication
```

This extension **requires an installation via composer** because of the usage of library s1lentium/iptools.

## Example for IP and IP-Range definitions in fe_groups.ip_mask

```
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.0/12
127.0.0.*
1001:5a3:3100:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
1001:5a3:3100:::::
1001:5a3:3100::/40
1001:5a3:3100:0000:*:*:*:*
```

You can use single ip addresses or ranges with subnetmask definition (e.g. `/8`). In addition it is possible to use
`*` as wildcards.
Simply define more ip addresses or ranges and split them with comma.

## Supported TYPO3- and PHP-Versions

* TYPO3 11.5
* TYPO3 12.4

* PHP 7.4
* PHP 8.0
* PHP 8.1
* PHP 8.2
* PHP 8.3

## Supported Extension

* fal_securedownload in version 4.0 or newer
* staticfilecache (see notes below)

## Static File Cache

The extension staticfilecache sets a cookie to identify, whether a user is logged in and the static file cache may not
be used. It hooks into the normal authentication process, when the user is initialized. With
EXT:in2frontendauthentication there are no specific frontend users, so it must be set here too.

This feature can be enabled in the extension settings in the extension manager.
